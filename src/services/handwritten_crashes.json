    "summary": "On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda operatives orchestrated a coordinated terrorist attack against the United States by hijacking four commercial airplanes. Two planes crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, one struck the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and the fourth crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to overcome the hijackers. The attacks resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths and profoundly reshaped global security policies and international relations.",

        "The attacks involved four Boeing aircraft models: two Boeing 767s and two Boeing 757s.

American Airlines Flight 77 and United Airlines Flight 93 were Boeing 757s departing from Washington Dulles Airport and Newark International Airport, respectively.",
        "The planes were selected because of their large fuel capacities for long-distance flights, which created massive explosions and structural damage upon impact.",

        "Osama bin Laden had previously issued fatwas in 1996 and 1998, declaring jihad against the United States.",
        "Operationally, the success of the attacks was facilitated by gaps in airport security, poor interagency intelligence sharing, and a general underestimation of the threat posed by non-state terrorist actors."

        "On the afternoon of 27 March 1977 Los Rodeos Airport was overwhelmed by traffic diverted from Gran Canaria after a terminal bomb explosion. Five wide body jets—including the two Boeing 747s involved—clogged the single taxiway, forcing every departure to back taxi along the active runway.",
        "As a coastal fog swept across the field, visibility for tower and crews plunged below 100 m. KLM 4805, having taken on an extra 45 tonnes of fuel, back taxied to the far threshold and turned to face Runway 30; behind it, Pan Am 1736 entered the same runway, instructed to leave via the third exit and join the parallel taxiway. In the dense cloud the Pan Am crew mis identified the un marked exits and was still on the runway when the KLM cockpit misunderstood a route clearance as a take off clearance.",
        "Captain van Zanten advanced the throttles; his first officer’s query and the tower’s “Stand by for take off—I will call you” were partly masked by a simultaneous Pan Am transmission: “We’re still taxiing down the runway, Clipper 1736!” None of the critical words reached the KLM cockpit through the heterodyned static. Moments later the KLM 747 accelerated toward V 1 while the Pan Am, creeping forward in the fog, suddenly saw landing lights bearing down. Captain Grubbs yanked full power and swerved left onto the grass; van Zanten rotated early, tail struck, but could not clear the obstacle.",
        "At 17:06 WET the KLM’s left side engines and landing gear sliced through Pan Am’s upper fuselage. The Dutch jet stalled, crashed 150 m beyond and exploded; the Pan Am broke apart and burned on the runway. 583 people died; 61—all from the Pan Am forward section—survived."

      "cause": [
        "The accident resulted from a series of human errors, including unclear communication, blocked radio transmissions, and the failure to question the captain’s decisions.

Twelve minutes later, at 18:24, a fault induced rupture of the rear pressure bulkhead caused an explosive decompression that tore away most of the vertical stabiliser and severed all four hydraulic systems. With every conventional control surface disabled, the 747 began wild phugoid climbs and descents and pronounced Dutch roll oscillations.",
        "The crew declared an emergency and attempted to return to Haneda, using differential engine thrust to steer and damp the oscillations. Lowering the landing gear (18:40) and later partial flap extension improved pitch stability but reduced yaw authority. For 32 minutes the aircraft wandered across central Honshū, gradually descending into mountainous terrain. At 18:56:30 the right wing struck a ridge near Mount Takamagahara; the 747 flipped, broke apart and exploded, creating the deadliest single aircraft crash in aviation history."
